## Scenario 1: Funnel Conversion Analysis

**Objective:** As a Product Manager for the `exp_button_color` experiment, you need to determine which variation led to a better user journey. The "better" journey is not just about final purchases but also about engagement at each step.

**Task:** For the `exp_button_color` experiment, calculate the conversion rate at each step of the user funnel:

1. **Homepage to CTA:** What percentage of unique users who viewed the homepage also clicked the CTA?
2. **CTA to Purchase:** Of the unique users who clicked the CTA, what percentage went on to make a purchase?

The final report should present these two conversion rates for both the `control` and `treatment` variations.

**Expected Output:**

| **variation_name** | **homepage_to_cta_rate** | **cta_to_purchase_rate** |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| control                  | 66.67                          | 50.00                          |
| treatment                | 100.00                         | 50.00                          |

## Scenario 2: Statistical Significance and Lift Calculation

**Objective:** The `exp_checkout_flow` experiment shows promising results in purchase value. The data science team needs key metrics to determine if the observed "lift" is statistically significant.

**Task:** For the `exp_checkout_flow` experiment, calculate the following metrics for both the `control` and `treatment` groups, considering only users who made a purchase:

1. `purchasing_users`: The count of unique users who made a purchase.
2. `avg_purchase_value`: The average value of purchases.
3. `stddev_purchase_value`: The sample standard deviation of purchase values.
4. `lift_pct`: The percentage increase in `avg_purchase_value` for the treatment group compared to the control group.

Exclude any users who were exposed to both variations of this experiment.

**Expected Output:**

| **variation_name** | **purchasing_users** | **avg_purchase_value** | **stddev_purchase_value** | **lift_pct** |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| control                  | 2                          | 95.00                        | 7.07                            | NULL               |
| treatment                | 2                          | 165.00                       | 21.21                           | 73.68              |

## Scenario 3: Identifying and Quantifying Invalid Experiment Data

**Objective:** An engineer suspects a bug might have exposed some users to both variations of an experiment, invalidating their data. Your task is to find these "contaminated" users and quantify the impact.

**Task:** Write a query to identify all users who were exposed to both the 'control' and 'treatment' variations of the *same experiment* at any point in their history.

For these contaminated users, the report should show the `user_id`, the `experiment_id` they were contaminated in, and the `total_contaminated_events` (the total number of event rows associated with that user and experiment).

**Expected Output:**

| **user_id** | **experiment_id** | **total_contaminated_events** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 999               | exp_checkout_flow       | 5                                   |
