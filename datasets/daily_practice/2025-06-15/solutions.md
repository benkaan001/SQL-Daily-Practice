## Question 1: Neighboring Cities by Population

**Task:** For every city with a population over 3 million, find another city **in the same country** with a population that is within 20% (either higher or lower) of its own. List the primary city's name and population, alongside the neighboring city's name and population. Ensure you don't list a city paired with itself.

**Expected Output:**
| primary_city_name  | primary_city_population | neighboring_city_name | neighboring_city_pop |

## Question 2: Countries with Unique Official Languages

**Task:** Identify countries that have exactly one official language recorded, where that same language is **not** an official language in any other country in the dataset. This will find countries with a truly unique official language.

## Question 3: Continent City Population Distribution

**Task:** For each continent, categorize its total city population into three buckets: 'Small' (cities under 1 million), 'Medium' (cities from 1 million to 5 million), and 'Large' (cities over 5 million). The final output should have one row per continent with the total population for each category.

**Expected Output:**
| continent     | small_city_population | medium_city_population | large_city_population |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Asia          | 0                     | 218471136              | 110279894             |
